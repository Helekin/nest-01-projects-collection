## Overview

This repository focuses entirely on database persistence and data management using NestJS.

The objective is to move from in-memory data handling to a real database-backed application, implementing validations, full CRUD operations, batch insertions, pagination, and containerized environments using Docker.

Throughout the project, we build a structured backend with proper database integration, emphasizing clean architecture and scalability.
